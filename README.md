//Hello World, 

   Chip here, oddly enough my "legal name" is actually Fredrick but I have gone by the name Chip my entire life as it's 
  a nickname for being the third generation. I suppose my parents wanted to be able to distinguish my calling name from my 
  father and grandfather and decided this name was appropriate. I am currently a Computer Science major pursuing my bachelors 
  degree at the University of Southern Mississippi in Long Beach, MS. 

   I first got started with computing machines by building them with my step-father, a good man, and playing FPS games
  online. Quickly the world of personal computing piqued my interest and since has driven me for more information and to 
  amass skills for the software sideof things.
