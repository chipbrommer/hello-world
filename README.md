//Hello World, 

  Chip here, oddly enough my "legal name" is actually Fredrick Brommer III but I have gone by the name Chip my 
entire life as it's a nickname for being the third. I am currently a Computer Science major pursuing my bachelors 
degree at the University of Southern Mississippi in Long Beach, MS. 

  I first got started with computers by building them and playing FPS games online. Quickly the world of personal
computing piqued my interest and since has driven me for more information and to amase skills for the software side
of things.
